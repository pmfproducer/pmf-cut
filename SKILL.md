description: PMF Cut — edit any video by conversation, in phases. Two tracks — SHORT-FORM (vertical 9:16 for Reels/TikTok/Shorts) and LONGFORM (horizontal 16:9 for YouTube: talking-head+B-roll, tutorials/screen-record, vlogs). PHASE 1 — clean cut + color grade + optional voice EQ/mastering (transcribe, select best takes, cut on silence for short-form or retention arc + cold open for longform, grade; ask if shot in LOG; master the voice), then show the user for approval. PHASE 2 (after the cut is approved) — Remotion visuals from a data-driven template: short-form gets karaoke captions, a static hook, a dynamic camera and behind-the-subject; longform gets B-roll cutaways, lower-thirds, chapter cards, callouts, plus YouTube chapters and .srt captions. PHASE 3 — soundtrack (AI via Treblo or a local file). Illustrative images/video via Pexels + Wikimedia/Google. Ask questions, confirm, execute, iterate, persist.

# PMF Cut

## Principle

1. **Two phases, one gate between them.** PHASE 1 is the clean cut + color grade. Show it and **wait for approval**. PHASE 2 (captions, graphics, images) only starts after the cut is signed off.
2. **LLM reasons from raw transcript + on-demand visuals.** The only derived artifact that earns its keep is the packed phrase-level transcript (`takes_packed.md`). Everything else you derive at decision time.
3. **Audio is primary, visuals follow.** Cut candidates come from speech boundaries and silence gaps.
4. **Ask → confirm → execute → iterate → persist.** Never touch the cut until the user confirms the strategy in plain English.
5. **Generalize.** Look at the material, ask the user, then edit — never assume what kind of video it is.
6. **Artistic freedom is the default.** Specific values here are worked examples, not mandates. Only the Hard Rules are mandatory.
7. **Verify your own output before showing it** — numbers first, images only where the numbers flag (see Self-eval).
8. **Spend tokens where taste lives.** Machine data (raw transcripts, captions.json, track.json, template code) is for programs, not for reading. Batch visual checks into one montage instead of N images.

## Hard Rules (production correctness — non-negotiable)

1. **The phase gate is real.** No Phase-2 work before the cut is approved.
2. **Per-segment extract → lossless `-c copy` concat**, never a single-pass filtergraph. (Under the default J-cut the picture and the sound of a take are extracted as separate ranges and the audio tracks are summed — that is the one sanctioned mix, and the video path is still per-segment + lossless concat.)
3. **30ms audio fades at every segment boundary** (encoded in render.py).
4. **Never cut inside a word** — snap to word boundaries from the transcript.
5. **Pad every cut edge** (30–200ms window; trail slightly longer than lead). Cut on silence whenever possible.
6. **Cache transcripts per source.** Never re-transcribe unless the source changed.
7. **Color grade per-segment during extraction**, never post-concat.
8. **Strategy confirmation before execution.**
9. **All session outputs in `<videos_dir>/edit/`** — never inside the pmf-cut repo.
10. **PHASE 2 is Remotion-only** — no ffmpeg/PIL burned text or overlays.
11. **PHASE 2 is data-driven.** Scaffold by copying the track template; describe the video in `public/edit-data.json`. **Never read or edit the template TSX** (`src/Main.tsx` etc.) — the only editable code file is `src/CustomGraphics.tsx`, only for bespoke graphics.
12. **Verify numerically first.** Run `verify_cut.py` on every rendered cut; open images only for flagged junctions. Batch any multi-frame look into one `contact_sheet.py` / `grade.py --candidates` montage.
13. **Never Read machine data into context**: `transcripts/*.json` (raw), `captions.json`, `track.json`, `segments.json`, matte/track binaries. Read `takes_packed.md` and helper stdout instead.

## Execution medium — ffmpeg pipeline (default) vs Adobe Premiere (MCP)

The default engine is the ffmpeg/Remotion pipeline below. **If the user wants the
edit done inside Adobe Premiere Pro via the `premiere-pro` MCP** (e.g. "edite a
sequência no Premiere", "corte via MCP"), the METHOD here is unchanged (audio-primary,
cut on silence, phase gate, grade with taste) but the hands change — **read
`references/premiere-mcp.md`** for the battle-tested Premiere workflow (razor +
ripple recipe, the V/A-link ripple caveat, `color_correct` LOG-strength lesson,
voice master, `export_frame` gotcha, tool cheat-sheet). Transcription/`edl.json`
are identical and cached — reuse an approved `edl.json`; skip `cut.mp4`/preview.

## Setup

First-time install lives in `install.md`. On cold start just verify:

- `GROQ_API_KEY` resolves (env or `.env` at the pmf-cut repo root). Groq Whisper `whisper-large-v3`; no diarization (every word is `speaker_0`).
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` (optional) — used for LONG sources (>5 min, e.g. YouTube/course lessons) via ElevenLabs Scribe `scribe_v1`, since Groq's free tier chokes on long uploads. `backend=auto` (default) picks Scribe over 5 min when the key exists, else Groq; short clips stay on Groq. No key → long sources fall back to Groq. Ask for it lazily the first time a >5 min source shows up, write to `.env`.
- `ffmpeg` + `ffprobe` on PATH; Python deps (`uv sync`); Node 18+ for Phase 2. `yt-dlp` only for URL sources (`ingest_url.py`) — install lazily (`brew install yt-dlp`) the first time a link shows up.
- The `remotion-best-practices` skill for Phase-2 domain knowledge (install from https://github.com/remotion-dev/skills if missing).
- Lazy keys, ask on first use, write to `.env` (never to `<videos_dir>`): `PEXELS_API_KEY` (images), `GOOGLE_API_KEY`+`GOOGLE_CSE_ID` (brand/people images fallback), `TREBLO_API_KEY` (AI music).

Helpers live in `helpers/`, resolved relative to this SKILL.md (symlinked at `~/.claude/skills/pmf-cut/`).

## Helpers

Phase 0 (see the Phase 0 section): **`fase0_server.py`** (the hub app) · `fase0_gerar.py` (HeyGen v3 + CLI) · `fase0_voz.py` (blocks + OmniVoice) · `omnivoice_worker.py` (keeps the model loaded between requests — loading costs ~10 s).

Phase 1:
- **`ingest_url.py <url> --dest <videos_dir> [--section 12:00-25:30] [--max-height 1080]`** — edit from a link: yt-dlp → MP4 (≤1080p, ascii-safe filename) straight into the videos dir; from there it's a source like any other. `--section` downloads ONLY a time range of a longform source (keyframe-accurate) — the cheap way to clip minutes 12–25 of a 1h video. `--simulate` prints title/duration/resolution without downloading (confirm before big fetches; run those in the background).
- **`transcribe.py <video> --edit-dir <edit> [--language pt] [--backend auto|groq|elevenlabs]`** — word-level, cached. `backend=auto` (default): ElevenLabs Scribe for sources >5 min (when `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` set), else Groq Whisper. Audio uploads as CBR 64kbps mono MP3 (~0.5 MB/min); oversized audio auto-chunks **by bytes**, so every chunk is guaranteed under Groq's 25 MB cap regardless of length. Chunks fetch **in parallel** with per-chunk resume cache and 5x backoff retries (provider blips don't restart the job).
- **`transcribe_batch.py <videos_dir> [--backend auto|groq|elevenlabs]`** — 4-worker parallel transcription for multi-take shoots; same per-file auto backend selection by length.
- **`pack_transcripts.py --edit-dir <dir>`** — transcripts → `takes_packed.md` (phrase-level, breaks on ≥0.5s silence). **The** reading view: 1/10 the tokens of raw JSON.
- **`speech_regions.py <video>`** — acoustic speech intervals via silencedetect. The source of truth for cut EDGES (Whisper times drift/stretch). Answers *where* speech is — never *how loud* it is.
- **`voice_levels.py <video> [--edit-dir <dir>] [--edl edl.json] [--drop-db 5]`** — the source of truth for speech LEVEL. Learns the noise floor (Ridler-Calvard intermeans, not a percentile) and the speaker's own median from the recording itself, then flags every phrase, sub-phrase run, and EDL range sitting ≥5 dB under that median and sizes a `gain_db` for each. Catches the failure nothing else sees: a whispered aside or a trailing-off sentence where every word is present, the transcript is perfect, `speech_regions` says "speech", `verify_cut` finds no pop and no dead air — and the viewer still hits a passage they cannot hear. **Run it in Phase 1 before writing the EDL.**
- **`detect_color.py <video> [--json]`** — resolves NORMAL vs LOG from the file instead of asking. Tier 1 metadata (HLG/PQ declare themselves; Apple Log's signature is ProRes 10-bit 4:2:2 + BT.2020 primaries + EMPTY transfer; vendor tags when present), Tier 2 image statistics when the metadata is silent — which is common, since a Sony shooting S-Log3 to H.264 often declares plain bt709 and any transcode drops the tags. Returns the profile, a **confidence**, the evidence, and the `grade` to apply (measured from the footage for non-Apple LOG). Only `confidence: low` should send you back to the user.
- **`render.py <edl.json> -o cut.mp4 --no-subtitles [--voice-master] [--keep-resolution] [--jobs N] [--no-jcut] [--jcut-lead N] [--jcut-tail-trim N]`** — per-segment extract (grade + fades, **parallel**) → **J-cut overlap assembly (default)** or lossless concat → optional voice master → loudnorm. Writes `jcut_timeline` into the EDL: the real output positions, which is what everything downstream must index off. Short-form fps is automatic: **30fps for 30fps+ sources, else 24** (longform keeps source fps via `--keep-resolution`). Set `edit-data.json` `fps` to match the resulting `cut.mp4`.
- **`verify_cut.py <edl.json> <cut.mp4> [--min-silence 1.2]`** — numeric self-eval: duration, per-junction pop/clipped-word probes, dead air, black frames, clipping, **and range level balance** (each range's RMS vs the median range; `LOW-LEVEL` under −4 dB). ~350 tokens of text instead of N images. The range-balance line is the convergence test for a `gain_db` fix — unlike `voice_levels`' run detector it compares a range against its peers rather than against a threshold it was selected by, so a corrected take actually stops being flagged.
- **`grade.py <in> -o <out>`** — grade presets/raw filters. **`--candidates "a=<filter>;b=<preset>;original=" --frame <t> -o cmp.png`** renders N looks on the SAME frame into one labeled montage.
- **`timeline_view.py <video> <start> <end>`** — filmstrip+waveform PNG for ONE flagged spot, not a scan tool.
- **`contact_sheet.py <video> --times t1 t2 … -o sheet.png`** — N frames in one labeled grid; the way to eyeball several moments **you already know**.
- **`watch_video.py <video> [--mode scene|keyframe|uniform] [--times t1 t2 …] [--start/--end] [--max-frames 24]`** — "what is IN this footage?" when you *don't* know where to look: scene-change detection (auto-fallback to uniform sampling on static/talking-head sources) + perceptual dedup (near-identical frames collapse — a held take becomes a handful of tiles) → labeled contact sheets in `edit/verify/watch_<stem>/`, one Read per sheet. Use for visual inventory of unknown material, eyeballing takes across sources, and surveying `cut.mp4` beyond verify_cut's numbers. `--times` pins transcript-cue frames: deictic moments from `takes_packed.md` ("olha isso", "como você pode ver") are LOW visual change and invisible to scene detection — pin them to decide B-roll/callout/zoom placement in Phase 2.

Phase 2/3 (see the track references for usage):
- **`captions_for_remotion.py`** (karaoke JSON) · **`face_track.py`** (eye-track JSON) · **`person_matte.py`** (RVM alpha matte; `uv sync --extra matting`) · **`pexels_search.py`** · **`wikimedia_images.py`** (no key, brands/people first choice) · **`google_images.py`** (fallback, mind rights) · **`captions_srt.py`** (longform .srt) · **`chapters.py`** (YouTube chapters) · **`treblo_music.py`** (AI soundtrack — pass a context-driven MUSICAL vibe: genre + instruments + tempo + mood, not SFX-y phrasing; auto-framed as a composed instrumental).

Interface:
- **`preview_server.py --root <edit> [--port 4820]`** — serves the standard preview interface (see the Preview interface section). App code lives at `assets/preview/` and is IMMUTABLE.

## Preview interface (standard — launch it at the start of every edit)

Every edit session gets the same interactive interface in the user's preview panel: a video-editor timeline (video track with filmstrip + audio track with waveform), a live playhead that scrubs the render in real time, per-take trim handles and take removal, and — from Phase 2 — caption and insert tracks. The layout follows the source aspect on its own: **vertical** sources put a tall player on the right with the transport + timeline on the left; **horizontal** sources keep the player stacked above the timeline. Dark glass, PMF Cut brand. **Never build a UI per session and never edit `assets/preview/`** — it is data-driven, like the Remotion templates.

**Launch (do this when a session starts, even before the first render — the UI shows a waiting state):**
1. Write `<edit>/state.json`:
   ```json
   {"project": "Nome — C0000", "phase": 1, "video": "cut.mp4", "edl": "edl.json",
    "captions": "remotion/public/captions.json", "editData": "remotion/public/edit-data.json",
    "finalVideo": "final.mp4", "fps": 24, "message": "Fase 1 — cortando",
    "sourceDurations": {"C0000": 1038.5},
    "awaitingStyle": false,
    "style": {"edit": "split", "captions": "karaoke",
              "elements": {"tracking": false, "zoomAuto": true, "zoomCuts": true, "musicAI": true}}}
   ```
   (`captions`/`editData`/`finalVideo` only when they exist; the Fase-2 tab plays `finalVideo` — the render WITH captions/inserts — while Fase 1 plays the clean cut; `sourceDurations` lets the UI clamp take extensions; `awaitingStyle`/`style` drive the Estilo tab below.)
2. Ensure `.claude/launch.json` has the config (adjust `--root` per session). The
   server takes the port by flag only, so pass the harness-assigned `$PORT` and
   set `autoPort` — port 4820 is often held by another session:
   `{"name": "pmfcut-preview", "runtimeExecutable": "sh", "runtimeArgs": ["-c", "exec python3 <skill>/helpers/preview_server.py --root '<edit>' --port \"$PORT\""], "autoPort": true, "port": 4820}`
3. `preview_start` with name `pmfcut-preview`.
4. **Arm the watcher IN THE SAME TURN as `preview_start`** — never later, never
   "when the user starts editing":
   `Monitor(command="python3 <skill>/helpers/watch_edits.py '<edit>'", description="escolhas e marcações salvas no preview", persistent=true)`

   Without it the UI still writes `preview_style.json` / `preview_edits.json` and
   **nothing happens** — the user clicks Salvar, sees the confirmation toast, and
   waits for work that was never triggered. The failure is silent on both ends:
   they think they told you, and you never heard. `ps aux | grep watch_edits`
   is the one-second check when you are unsure.

**Keep state.json fresh** — bump `phase` and `message` at each milestone (cut rendered, cut approved, Phase 2 rendered…). The UI polls and hot-reloads by itself; waveform + filmstrip regenerate automatically when cut.mp4 changes.

The timeline shows one track per KIND: markers, captions, video, audio (the mix),
**A1 / A2** (the J-cut takes), **text** overlays (hook), **images** (inserts + any
data-driven CustomGraphics windows), soundtrack. Anything you leave in code instead
of data simply will not appear.

**A1 / A2 are folded inside the audio track**, opened by the caret on its chip —
they answer "where is the J-cut", which is a question you ask once, so they do not
sit on screen competing with the mix. They exist whenever the EDL carries a
`jcut_timeline`; the caret only appears then. The open/closed choice is remembered
across reloads (`localStorage`), so do not expect a fixed initial state.

Takes alternate between the two lanes, exactly as two audio tracks read in an NLE
— on a single lane an overlap is invisible, because two blocks sharing time just
look like one long block. The hatched orange head on each block is the lead: how
much voice arrives before that take's picture. Hover gives frames and tail trim.

Two structural constraints, learned the hard way:
- **Nothing in the ancestor chain of `.track-label` may have `overflow:hidden`** —
  the gutter mask rides `position:sticky` there, and an overflow ancestor makes a
  new scroll container and strands it. That rules out the usual max-height
  accordion; the reveal animates the blocks instead.
- **The panel's `pointerdown` must ignore the gutter.** It falls through to a
  scrub branch that calls `setPointerCapture` on the panel, which retargets the
  following click — a real click on a gutter control was swallowed entirely (while
  a programmatic `.click()` worked, which is what makes it confusing to diagnose)
  and the needle jumped to 0, since the gutter sits left of t=0.

**What the user can do in the UI:** scrub, trim take edges, delete takes, drag
insert/hook chips — and **mark correction ranges**: park the needle, press `M`
(or the IN button), move to the end of the problem, press `M` again — the note box
opens centred over the timeline — then type what should change. Many ranges per pass. Zoom: the slider is anchored on the needle, trackpad pinch
on the pointer. Shortcuts live behind the **?** button at the bottom right.

### The Estilo tab (between Fase 1 and Fase 2)

The cut is approved and nothing about the LOOK of Fase 2 is decided yet. **Do not
ask the style questions in chat** — set `"awaitingStyle": true` in `state.json`
and the UI opens its own tab, sitting between FASE 1 and FASE 2:

- **Tipo de edição** — `limpa` ("Limpa": no split inserts, full frame throughout —
  **the default**, and the right pick for a talking-head cut or when the user will
  place images by hand later), `split` ("Tela dividida"), `split2` ("Tela
  dividida 2").
- **Cor de destaque** — `accent`, a hex. Sits BEFORE the text styles, because it
  is what they paint with. One spectral swatch (the OS picker) plus a hex field,
  synced both ways — no preset row. Only `realce`/`misto` headlines and the
  `stacked` caption paint an accent, so the save also carries **`accentUsed`**;
  when it is `false` the picked styles have none and the colour is not an
  instruction to invent a place for one.
- **Estilo de headline** — `outline`, `card`, `realce`, `misto`. Always two
  lines, size fitted to the text (see the track reference).
- **Estilo de legenda** — three animated (`karaoke`, `stacked`/"Empilhado",
  `scatter`/"Disperso") and three static (`simples`, `serifada`, `classica`).
- **Elementos da edição** — checkboxes: `tracking` (movimento de tracking),
  `zoomAuto` (automação de zoom in), `zoomCuts` (zoom in/out nos cortes),
  `flashCut` (flash na transição), `swipeCut` (swipe na transição),
  `musicAI` (trilha sonora com IA), plus a free-text observation field.
  `flashCut` and `swipeCut` share `transitions[]` and differ by `type` — and they
  do NOT share a sound: flash is a click, swipe is a whoosh (peak-anchored) plus a
  click. See the transitions section of the track reference before mixing.

Saving writes `<edit>/preview_style.json` (its OWN file — a style pick and a
timeline correction are different screens at different moments, and one shared
file would clobber the other) and `watch_edits.py` notifies you with the picks,
**what was left out**, and the observation. Then: build Fase 2 from exactly those
choices, **copy them into `state.json` as `style`**, clear `awaitingStyle`, and
delete `preview_style.json`.

Writing `style` back is not bookkeeping — it is what keeps the tab open. The tab
is enabled while `awaitingStyle` OR `style` is set, so the user can return, change
a caption style or tick one more element, and save again. That save arrives with
`"rerender": true` and the watcher says **REFAÇA a Fase 2** — re-render with the
new choices, don't treat it as a first pick.

**The catalog lives in `STYLE_CATALOG` (app.js), not in a session.** A new editing
or caption style is one entry there plus its implementation in the track
reference; adding it in chat only, for one project, makes it invisible to every
other project. What is in it today is the **short-form** vocabulary (tela
dividida, karaokê/empilhado) — on a longform job the gate has nothing to offer
yet, so skip `awaitingStyle` and ask the layer questions in chat until longform
entries exist here.

**When the user saves timeline edits**, the UI writes `<edit>/preview_edits.json`
(never touches edl.json) and `watch_edits.py` notifies you automatically. To apply:
- `notes[]` — free-text correction requests, each with `start`/`end` on the draft
  timeline plus `renderedStart`/`renderedEnd` on the current `cut.mp4`, and the
  `phase` tab the user was on. Use the RENDERED pair to find the moment in the
  existing render. These are instructions in the user's words — read them, then do
  the edit they describe (re-cut, re-grade, swap an insert, fix a caption…).
- `edl.changes` / `edl.removed` — validate each new edge against
  `speech_regions.py` (warn if an edge clips a word — the user's intent wins, but
  say so), update `edl.json`, re-render, `verify_cut.py`.
- `editData` — insert/hook/behind timings → edit-data.json → re-render Phase 2.

Then delete `preview_edits.json` and update `state.json`.

# PHASE 0 — generation (optional, before the cut)

For when there is **no footage yet** — only a script — and the video will be a
talking avatar. Ask; never assume a job starts here. With footage, go to Phase 1.

**Run the hub** (a local app, not a pipeline — script, voice, avatar and video
each keep their own state and open in any order):

```bash
uv run helpers/fase0_server.py --out <videos_dir>/fase0 [--port 4830]
```

Open it in the Browser pane (a `launch.json` entry shaped like the preview one).
The `.env` at the repo root is read on its own.

| Piece | What happens | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Roteiro | the text is split into blocks so ONE sentence can be redone alone | free |
| Voz | each block spoken by OmniVoice, locally, then joined with a 0.22s breath | free |
| Avatar | the account's OWN HeyGen looks (`ownership=private`: 2 pages instead of 197) | free |
| Vídeo | HeyGen v3 renders the avatar lip-synced to that voice | **PAID** |

**The video render spends real credit — get an explicit yes before triggering
it**, the same way a purchase needs one. The app shows the wallet balance.
"Pro corte" copies `fase0.mp4` into `<out>/../videos/`, where it becomes an
ordinary Phase-1 source.

Things the code already encodes — do not undo them:
- **HeyGen's audio is thrown away.** It loudnorms the return and eats SNR; the
  original WAV is re-muxed over the picture. **No `-shortest`** in that mux — it
  closes on the shorter stream and also eats the AAC priming: measured, 2.30s of
  voice came out as 1.963s, the last word cut. If the WAV is longer, the last
  frame is held.
- **Blocks break only on `.` `!` `?`.** A colon announces a continuation; splitting
  there made "Terceiro, agenda: dia, hora…" two separately synthesized blocks, and
  the voice closed "agenda" as a sentence end with a breath before "dia".
- **Library functions raise `Fase0Erro`, never `sys.exit`.** They run inside the
  server's threads, where SystemExit escapes `except Exception`: a failed paid
  render stayed on "renderizando" forever.
- **The server only answers its own address.** It serves files and triggers a
  paid render, so: paths are confined to their folder (`/assets/../../.env` used to
  return the key file), `Host` must be `127.0.0.1`/`localhost` on its port (DNS
  rebinding), and POST must be JSON from our own Origin (a `text/plain` POST from
  any open website used to start the render). Never loosen these to "fix" a call.

**Voices** live in the OmniVoice install (`~/Developer/OmniVoice/vozes/`, catalog in
`vozes.json`), never in this repo — **this repo is public, and a `.pt` voice
prompt is a clone of a real person's voice.** Cloning from the app needs a RAW
camera/mic take: mastered audio makes the clone copy the compression and EQ too.

CLI without the app: `fase0_gerar.py --roteiro r.txt --so-voz` (free, stops before
HeyGen) · `--listar-avatares` · `--avatar <look_id>` (paid).

# PHASE 1 — Clean cut + color grade

Goal: best take of every beat, cut on silence, graded image, clean `cut.mp4` for approval. No text, no graphics.

1. **Inventory.** URL source? `ingest_url.py` first (`--section` when only a range of a longform video matters). `ffprobe` every source. `transcribe_batch.py` (or `transcribe.py`) → `pack_transcripts.py` → read `takes_packed.md`. Note dimensions/orientation and whether it looks flat/LOG. Material you can't picture from the transcript → `watch_video.py` for a one-Read visual survey.
2. **Pre-scan** `takes_packed.md` for verbal slips, mis-speaks, and dead-air-stretched words (Whisper stretches a word's end across silence — verify long "phrases" against `speech_regions.py`/waveform before trusting them). **Then run `voice_levels.py` on every source** — the transcript is level-blind, so an inaudible passage reads exactly like a normal one. Anything it flags is a decision to make BEFORE the EDL: boost it with `gain_db`, or cut the take entirely.
3. **Converse.** Describe what you see; ask questions shaped by the material (content type, target length/aspect, pacing, must-keep/must-cut). No fixed checklist.
4. **Detect the colour profile — do NOT ask.** Run `detect_color.py <source>`.
   The answer is in the file; asking put a measurable question on the user.
   - **`rec709` (normal)** → no grade. `"grade": ""`. A standard profile already
     carries its look; "improving" it loses the match with the user's other material.
   - **LOG / HLG / PQ** → apply the helper's `grade` field and say so in one line.
     Apple Log uses its approved preset; any other LOG gets an expansion **measured
     from that footage**, not a guessed vendor curve.
   - **`confidence: low`** → the ONLY case that still asks. It means the statistics
     are ambiguous — a bright, shadowless scene has the same lifted black floor as
     a LOG curve. Show what was measured, then ask.
   Still show the `--candidates` montage before committing a LOG grade: detection
   picks the curve, the user picks the look.
5. **Propose the cut strategy** (4–8 sentences: shape, takes, cut direction, grade direction, length estimate). **Wait for confirmation.**
6. **Execute.** Produce `edl.json` (schema below; editor sub-agent brief for multi-take). Set cut edges from `speech_regions.py`, not raw Whisper times. Render: `render.py edl.json -o cut.mp4 --no-subtitles` (+`--voice-master` if wanted; longform: `--keep-resolution`). **The J-cut runs by default** — see below; you do not ask for it and you do not configure it per project.
7. **Self-eval (numeric first).** `verify_cut.py edl.json cut.mp4` (longform: `--min-silence 1.2`). Clean → done. Flags → `timeline_view` ONLY the flagged junctions, fix, re-render. Cap 3 loops, then surface remaining flags to the user.
8. **Show `cut.mp4` and wait for approval.** The phase gate.
9. **Open the Estilo tab** — `"awaitingStyle": true` in `state.json`, and let the
   user pick the editing style, the caption style and the edit elements in the UI
   (see "The Estilo tab"). Do NOT ask this in chat. Only then read the track
   reference: **`references/shortform.md`** or **`references/longform.md`**.

## J-cut — the default Phase-1 cleanup

Takes are OVERLAPPED, not butted. The outgoing take's audio runs to its natural
end; the incoming take's audio starts `lead` frames earlier **on its own track**
and the two are summed; the incoming PICTURE starts where the outgoing audio ends,
skipping `lead` frames of its own head. The voice arrives before the face.

Why it is the default: a straight concat leaves a beat of silence at every
junction — the outgoing take keeps its trailing pad and the incoming one starts
with its own. Measured on a real 3-take edit: **130ms and 140ms**. Small on paper,
a clear pause in the room. The J-cut removes it and the takes interlock.

Defaults, in `render.py`: **lead 5 frames**, **tail trim up to 2 frames**.
Override per project with `"jcut": {"lead_frames": N, "tail_trim_frames": N}`;
turn it off with `"jcut": false` or `--no-jcut` (single-range EDLs skip it anyway).

Three things that are not obvious:

- **Tighten with the TAIL, not the lead.** A bigger lead also pushes the picture
  deeper into the incoming take's speech, which reads as entering mid-word. The
  tail trim tightens the seam and leaves the picture entry alone. Measured: 5f
  lead alone gave 62/46ms of interlock; adding a 2f tail trim doubled it to
  129/112ms with the picture still entering 140ms into the speech.
- **The tail trim is measured, never blind.** `render.py` reads the silence
  actually present at the end of each range and trims at most that (keeping 10ms).
  A fixed 2 frames would eventually decapitate a word on a take that ends tight.
- **Sync is by construction:** `video_in = audio_in + lead` and
  `video_offset = audio_offset + lead`. Break that pairing and the take drifts.

`render.py` writes a `jcut_timeline` block into the EDL — the real output
positions. Everything downstream (preview timeline, `segments.json`, Phase-2
overlays) must index off THAT, not off the sum of the ranges: the J-cut output is
shorter than `Σ(end−start)`, so summing places every take after the first too late.

## Color grade

Reason about the image, don't preset-blind. Mental model ASC CDL: per channel `out = (in*slope + offset)**power`, then saturation. Applied per-segment at extraction (Hard Rule 7).

- **Iterate on ONE frame via a candidates montage, and let the user choose:**
  `grade.py <src> --candidates "punch=eq=contrast=1.15:saturation=1.25;suave=…;original=" --frame <t> -o edit/verify/grades.png` — one image, all looks labeled, side by side. Only render the full cut once the grade is locked.
- **Build from spaceless filters** so the string survives the EDL: `eq=…`, `colorbalance=…`, `colorlevels=…`. No `curves` with spaces (breaks filtergraph parsing).
- **The grade always runs at 8-bit.** `render.py` prepends `format=yuv420p` to the
  grade segment of the vf chain, because ffmpeg's `colorlevels` is broken on 9–14
  bit RGB — on a 10-bit source it collapses the frame to a constant TV black
  (measured `YAVG=64/1023`, `YBITDEPTH=1` on an iPhone Apple Log ProRes) while
  behaving correctly at 8- and 16-bit. `curves`, `colorbalance`, `hue` and `eq` are
  bit-depth-safe. Keep that guard in front of any new grade caller.
- **Standard/Rec.709** → light corrective or none. A user `.cube` goes first as `lut3d=`.

### LOG profiles — what `detect_color.py` is deciding

`detect_color.py` resolves this automatically; the table below is what it encodes
and what you need when reading its evidence or extending it. Probe by hand only
when the helper reports `low` confidence:

```bash
ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 \
  -show_entries stream=codec_name,profile,color_transfer,color_primaries,color_space \
  -show_entries stream_tags=com.apple.proapps.logprofile -of default=nw=1 <source>
```

| What you see | Profile | Grade |
|---|---|---|
| `codec_name=prores`, `pix_fmt=yuv422p10le`, `color_primaries=bt2020`, `color_transfer=unknown`, encoder tag `Apple ProRes` | **Apple Log** | preset `apple_log` |
| `color_transfer=arib-std-b67` | HLG | tonemapped by `render.py`; light corrective only |
| `color_transfer=smpte2084` | PQ / HDR10 | tonemapped by `render.py`; light corrective only |
| Sony `slog3`/`s-gamut3`, Panasonic `v-log`, Canon `clog3` in the tags | that vendor's LOG | its own expansion — build one, then add it to `PRESETS` |

**Nothing in the file says "Apple Log".** The signature above IS the
identification — measured on a real iPhone ProRes file: BT.2020 primaries, a
10-bit 4:2:2 ProRes stream, and an EMPTY transfer tag. If you wait for a tag that
names the profile you will never find one, and an HDR-only check calls it plain SDR.

**Apple Log is the one that is already proven** (`apple_log` in `grade.py`,
approved 2026-07 on an iPhone ProRes talking head): cool, contrasty, skin rosy.
Two things about it that are not obvious:
- The file declares **BT.2020 primaries with an empty transfer tag**, so an
  HDR-only check reads it as ordinary SDR. `render.py`'s `wide_gamut_chain`
  converts it to Rec.709 before the grade — the preset assumes that already ran.
- `hue=h=-9` is load-bearing: expanding Apple Log pushes skin yellow-green, and
  the negative rotation brings it back. Rotating positive makes it worse.
- Its `colorlevels` **must** be fed 8-bit (see the 8-bit bullet above). LOG sources
  are the 10-bit ones, so this preset is exactly where the bug bites — and it bites
  silently: the `--candidates` montage grades an 8-bit frame and looks right, so
  only the rendered cut goes black. `verify_cut.py` catches it on the "black
  frames" line; don't dismiss that line as a false positive on a LOG source.

Still show the candidates montage and get a pick — a preset is a starting point,
not permission to skip the approval.
- **Skin is the guardrail.** The moment skin goes orange/magenta/clipped, back off. Check a mid-shot face at each step.
- **Relative tweaks** ("+1 exposure", "mais saturação") → nudge that one term, re-montage the same frame, show again.
- **Rec.709 is the only color space allowed to leave Phase 1.** `render.py` handles
  this (tonemaps HDR, converts wide-gamut SDR, tags every output bt709/tv) — but
  VERIFY on the rendered cut: `ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0
  -show_entries stream=color_space,color_primaries,color_range cut.mp4` must read
  bt709 / bt709 / tv. Anything else means a second interpretation is still alive
  downstream: Chrome (Remotion's decoder in Phase 2) re-reads those tags and
  silently re-grades the image — typically ~1.2 gamma darker with a hue shift — so
  the Phase-2 render stops matching the cut the user approved. Phone/mirrorless
  sources routinely write bt2020 primaries with `color_transfer=unknown`; that is
  wide-gamut SDR, **not** HDR, and an HDR-only check will miss it.

## Voice EQ + mastering (optional Phase-1 audio polish)

Opt-in: `render.py … --voice-master` or `"voice_master": true` in the EDL. Runs after compositing, before loudnorm. Chain (`VOICE_MASTER_CHAIN` in render.py): highpass 80 → mud cut −2.5dB@200 → compressor (3:1, −20dB, makeup 3) → presence +2.5dB@3.2k → air +3dB@9k shelf → deesser → limiter 0.95.

Tune per voice: brighter → raise treble/3.2k; warmer → back those off, lift ~200Hz; more "radio" → lower threshold / raise ratio; more natural → ratio 2, threshold −24dB. **Verify:** `ffmpeg -i cut.mp4 -af astats -vn -f null -` → Flat factor 0, peak < 0dB; loudnorm summary ≈ −14 LUFS / TP ≤ −1. Then let the user hear it.

## Cut craft

- Silences ≥ 400ms are the cleanest cuts; 150–400ms usable with a check; < 150ms unsafe.
- Preserve peaks (laughs, punchlines, emphasis) — extend past a punchline to include the reaction.
- Every cut must work on audio AND video.

**Fine-comb the silences — Whisper times are NOT cut edges:**
- Onsets drift early (bakes dead air at a segment head); ends stretch across silence (a 4s "phrase" may be 1s of talk); restarts get collapsed into one stretched word (the doubled take is invisible in text but audible).
- Fix: edges from `speech_regions.py` — start → region onset −30ms, end → offset +50–80ms (the trail keeps the word's decay; cutting at the offset clips the last sibilant). Inside merged speech blocks, place the edge by eye on a fine `timeline_view`.
- If the user flags a gap/clip after render, re-run `speech_regions.py` around that timestamp — don't nudge blindly.
- **A stretched word can hide a false start, and the stretch also mis-attributes every word around it.** When "de" spans 6.16→8.64, the words the source transcript places on either side may belong to *different takes* — the speaker trailed off, paused, and restarted the whole sentence. The text shows one clean sentence; the audio holds two attempts.
- **Never conclude a range is missing content from the SOURCE transcript's word times.** Extract the exact range and transcribe it in isolation — no surrounding context for the LM to complete from. If the answer changes a deliverable (a caption rewrite, dropping a take), get a second opinion from the other backend (`--backend elevenlabs` vs `groq`); two models agreeing on an isolated clip is trustworthy, one model reading the full file is not.
- **Rotation:** phone clips are often stored landscape with a ±90° display-matrix; render.py handles it — don't force dimensions.

**Level the takes — presence is not audibility:**
- People drop their voice on asides, parentheticals and sentence tails ("além de, *claro*, …"). It sounds natural in the room and disappears on a phone speaker. The transcript is perfect, so nothing in the text pipeline flags it.
- Find it with `voice_levels.py --edl edl.json`: it reports each range's average AND the worst low run inside it, and suggests a `gain_db`. Size the gain off the **worst run**.
- Fix it per-range with `gain_db`, never with a global compressor.
- Confirm with `verify_cut.py`'s range-balance line. Target a ~2 dB spread between ranges — that is levelled. Driving it to 0 dB flattens the delivery and lifts room tone for nothing.
- Room tone is the real ceiling on a boost, not clipping. Before committing a large gain, compare the boosted take's internal pause against a pause elsewhere in the cut; if the boosted one is now the louder pause, back off.

## Editor sub-agent brief (multi-take selection)

```
You are editing a <type> video. Pick the best take of each beat and assemble
chronologically by beat, not clip order.
INPUTS: takes_packed.md; narrative context (2 sentences); speaker note;
expected structure (archetype or invent); verbal slips to avoid; target runtime.
Archetypes: launch (HOOK→PROBLEM→SOLUTION→BENEFIT→EXAMPLE→CTA); tutorial
(INTRO→SETUP→STEPS→GOTCHAS→RECAP); interview (Q→A→FOLLOWUP…); essay
(COLD-OPEN→THESIS→POINTS→COUNTER→CONCLUSION→CTA); vlog; or invent.
RULES: edges on word boundaries; pad 30–200ms; prefer ≥400ms silences; keep
unavoidable slips only if no better take (note in "reason"); if over budget,
drop a beat or trim tails and report.
OUTPUT (JSON array, no prose):
[{"source":"C0103","start":2.42,"end":6.85,"beat":"HOOK","quote":"…","reason":"…"}]
```

For a single long source (longform), the main context can pick cuts directly from `takes_packed.md`; for sources > ~30 min, delegate to the sub-agent so the full transcript never enters the main context.

## EDL format (Phase 1)

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "sources": {"C0103": "/abs/path/C0103.MP4"},
  "grade": "eq=contrast=1.06:saturation=1.05",
  "voice_master": true,
  "jcut": {"lead_frames": 5, "tail_trim_frames": 2},
  "ranges": [
    {"source": "C0103", "start": 2.42, "end": 6.85, "beat": "HOOK",
     "quote": "…", "reason": "…", "gain_db": 0,
     "chapter": "Only on longform section openers"}
  ],
  "total_duration_s": 87.4
}
```

`grade`: preset name, raw filter, or `"auto"` — normally whatever `detect_color.py`
returned. `chapter` fields feed `chapters.py` (longform).

`jcut`: optional. **Omit it and the J-cut runs with the defaults** (lead 5f, tail
trim up to 2f); `false` butt-joins instead. After a render, `render.py` adds a
`jcut_timeline` array — the real per-take video/audio offsets in the output. That
block, not `Σ(end−start)`, is the timeline Phase 2 and the preview must use.

`gain_db`: per-range level correction in dB, sized by `voice_levels.py`. Applied at
extraction, before the edge fades, with a limiter on any boost so a loud syllable
inside a quiet take cannot clip. This is the fix for an under-level take — not a
global compressor, which would pump the good takes to rescue the bad one.
Cap around +12 dB: past that the room tone rises with the voice and the take
starts sounding like a different microphone.

---

# PHASE 2 + 3 — read the track reference (after the gate)

The cut is approved and the user picked the style in the UI (`preview_style.json`)
→ load **one** file and build exactly what was picked:

- **Vertical / Reels / TikTok / Shorts → read `references/shortform.md`.** Karaoke captions, static hook headline, dynamic camera, inserts, behind-the-subject, SFX, soundtrack.
- **Horizontal / YouTube / tutorial / vlog → read `references/longform.md`.** Retention cut is there too (read it BEFORE Phase 1 on longform jobs), B-roll, lower-thirds, chapter cards, callouts, .srt + chapters, soundtrack.

Both tracks: scaffold with one `cp -R` of the template, describe the video in `public/edit-data.json`, verify with montage stills, render, loudnorm, deliver `edit/final.mp4`. Load the `remotion-best-practices` skill when writing any Remotion code (CustomGraphics).

## Memory — `project.md`

Append one section per session at `<edit>/project.md`:

```markdown
## Session N — YYYY-MM-DD
**Phase reached:** …  **Strategy:** …
**Decisions:** takes, cuts, grade (LOG?), layer choices + why
**Outstanding:** deferred items
```

On startup, read it if it exists and summarize the last session in one sentence before asking whether to continue.

## Anti-patterns

- Triggering the Phase-0 video render (`/api/video`, `fase0_gerar.py --avatar`)
  without an explicit yes. It is the only step in the pipeline that spends money.

- Starting Phase 2 before cut approval (the gate is a Hard Rule).
- Asking the style questions in chat, or starting Phase 2 before the pick lands.
  The gate screen exists so the user SEES what each style does — a chat list of
  names asks them to choose blind. Set `awaitingStyle` and wait for
  `preview_style.json`.
- Treating an unchecked element as "não pediu". It is an explicit NO: the user
  looked at "Movimento de tracking" and left it off. `watch_edits.py` prints the
  `fora:` line for exactly this reason.
- Hardcoding `#ff5200` (or any accent) in the template. The Estilo tab lets the
  user pick it, so a literal makes the preview show their colour and the render
  show orange — worse than not offering the choice. Feed `accent` into
  `hook.accent` + `captions.accent`.
- Changing a caption's look in the template without changing its preview in
  `app.js` (`buildKaraokeDemo` / `buildStackedDemo`). The gate's previews render
  the real faces, sizes and motion, scaled from 1080-wide — that is the whole
  reason the user can choose by looking. A preview that lies about the style is
  worse than no preview.
- Reading `transcripts/*.json`, `captions.json`, `track.json`, `segments.json`, or template TSX into context — machine data; read `takes_packed.md`/helper output instead.
- Editing `src/Main.tsx` — the template is data-driven; the JSON is the edit.
- Hardcoding a bespoke graphic's timings inside `CustomGraphics.tsx`. Put the
  windows in an `edit-data.json` array (a key the template ignores, e.g.
  `splitInserts`) and map over it — otherwise the graphic is invisible to the
  preview timeline and the user cannot see or retime it.
- Re-rendering Phase 1 without regenerating `segments.json`. Every Phase-2
  overlay that must land on a cut is indexed off that file; stale, it is off by
  frames and nothing errors. Worse, a `VIDEO_LAG`-style constant can absorb the
  first frame of the drift and make a broken file look correct at the one
  boundary you happen to check.
- `timeline_view` on every boundary — run `verify_cut.py` and image ONLY the flags.
- N single-frame images when one `contact_sheet.py` / `--candidates` montage answers it.
- Setting cut edges from Whisper word times (drift/stretch/collapsed repeats) — use `speech_regions.py`.
- Judging audio by the transcript. A perfect transcript says nothing about level: Whisper reads a whisper fine, the viewer does not. Run `voice_levels.py` on every source in Phase 1.
- Rewriting a caption, or telling the user a sentence broke, on the strength of the source transcript's word times. Transcribe the isolated range first — a stretched word mis-attributes its neighbours and an under-level passage is usually a false start the speaker already re-took.
- Sizing a range's `gain_db` off the range average — a range holding a whispered clause plus a normal one averages out to "fine" while the whisper stays inaudible. Size it off the WORST low run inside the range (`voice_levels.py --edl` does this).
- Chasing `voice_levels`' low-run numbers to zero on a corrected render. Runs are SELECTED for being under the threshold, so the passage you just fixed still lists its decay tails. Convergence is `verify_cut.py`'s range-balance line; a ~2 dB spread between ranges is a finished job, 0 dB is over-flattened delivery.
- Fixing an under-level take with a global compressor or `--voice-master` — that pumps the takes that were already fine. Use per-range `gain_db`.
- Cutting exactly at a word's offset (clips the sibilant) — leave the 50–80ms trail.
- Committing a grade without the one-frame candidates montage + user pick.
- Shipping a `cut.mp4` that is not tagged bt709/tv — Phase 2 will re-interpret it and the approved grade drifts.
- Delivering Phase 2 with Remotion's own audio track — it drifts progressively against the source (+0.66s by 78s on a 95s edit). Re-mux `cut.mp4`'s audio and mix the soundtrack in ffmpeg (recipe in the track reference).
- Shipping a short-form whose FRAME 0 has no headline on it. Schedulers take the post's cover from the first frame, so a hook that fades in hands the feed a thumbnail with an empty card. `hook.introFrames` defaults to 0 for this reason — verify with a `--frame=0` still, never by eye on a later frame.
- Rebuilding the transition SFX in the delivery mux as one click for every entry. Flash and swipe are different sounds — walk `transitions[]` and emit per `type`. It passes every numeric check (the audio IS there) and the swipe silently loses the whoosh that is its entire point.
- Delaying a slow-attack SFX by the cut time. `whoosh.mp3` peaks 215ms into a 450ms swell, so that lands the hit after the picture already changed. Anchor by the measured PEAK; only a click (peak ~7ms) can be delayed by the cut time directly.
- Judging A/V sync with short correlation windows — speech is quasi-periodic and a 2–3s window happily locks onto the wrong syllable, inventing a drift. Use 15s+ windows, and remember a PARTIAL render cannot show drift that accumulates over the full timeline.
- Burning captions/overlays with ffmpeg/PIL — Phase 2 is Remotion-only.
- Asking "NORMAL ou LOG?" — that is `detect_color.py`'s job now. Ask only on `confidence: low`.
- Butt-joining the takes. The J-cut is the default; `--no-jcut` is a deliberate exception, not a shortcut.
- Tightening a J-cut seam by raising the lead. That buys tightness by shoving the picture deeper into the incoming take's speech. Trim the outgoing TAIL instead.
- A fixed tail trim. It must be bounded by the silence actually measured at that range's end, or it eventually cuts a word off.
- `adelay` in milliseconds when placing overlapped audio, or `-shortest` on the mux. `adelay`'s integer-ms rounding leaves the mix a fraction short of the video and `-shortest` then amputates whole FRAMES of picture — and whether it bites depends on which way the numbers round, so it passes by luck until it doesn't. Delay in samples (`=NS`), and pin the length with `-t`.
- Indexing Phase 2 off `Σ(end−start)` when a `jcut_timeline` exists — the J-cut output is shorter, so everything after the first take lands late.
- Assuming the color profile without running the detector.
- Re-transcribing cached sources; re-rendering Phase 1 when only Phase 2 changed.
- Launching the preview without arming `watch_edits.py` in the same turn. This
  is the one failure mode where the user reasonably believes they handed you a
  decision and you never got it — the toast says saved, the file is written, and
  no one is reading it.
- Building a per-session preview UI — launch the standard interface and feed it `state.json`. (Improving `assets/preview/` itself IS allowed when the user asks for a UI change; it is shared, so the improvement lands for every project.)
- Applying `preview_edits.json` blindly — validate new edges against `speech_regions.py` first (flag clipped words to the user).
- Assuming what kind of video it is. Look first, ask second, edit last.
